# Fastapi-demo

## Made this demo while drinking beer at FOSDEM. Use it at your own risk :)

### Goal
- get more familiar with FastAPI backend
- have a simple frontend

 ### How to host? Many options! I did the following:
 - Buy your own DNS
 - Spin a cloud instance
   - Get the public IP
   - Allow traffic from the outside to HTTP/HTTPS
 - Add an A record to your DNS
   - Bonus tip: you can use sub-domains
 - Setup reverse proxy on your server
